# prehistory
A project for the PreHackstoric hackathon hosted by MLH.
Let's go back in time to the Prehistoric period!
We've created a fun platform 'JURRASIC WORLD' having two sections. 
GAMEZONE & TREASURE PARK.

GAMEZONE : 
A dino game which shows our love for Dino & Prehistoric Era!
This game is purely built in HTML, CSS, JS.

TREASURE PARK:
This comes under an e-commerce platform, where you can actually shop old stone age things and cherrish your life.
Technologies used are HTML, CSS, JS and NODEJS for backend
